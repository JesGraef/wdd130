                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given 
                    the nickname as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of 
                    folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br>
                    <br>
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river are also 
                    commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over 
                    the sandy beaches in the campsites.</p>

            <div class="rafting2-grid">
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river 
                    flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, 
                    and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts 
                    outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human 
                    activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
