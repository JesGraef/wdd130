                <p>As it’s been said many times before, good music can make us happy instantenously! If you’re 
                    feeling down or tired, and you decide to play some music you love, you immediately feel happy! 
                    According to science and research, listening to the music releases dopamine 
                    chemicals in our brain which makes us feel happier. </p>
                <p>Since there are so many kinds of music, and depending on what interests you have, it’s a wise 
                    decision to choose the best music that can positively affect your moods! I’ve identified here 
                    3 kinds of music that can immediately boost your mood!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Nostalgic Music</h3>
            <div class="music1">
                <p>Have you ever experienced listening to the radio, for example you were driving in your car, and 
                    suddenly it played an old song, probably goes back to the time when you were a kid. And all of 
                    a sudden, it brings back so many happy memories of the good old times. This is what I mean for 
                    nostalgic music. </p> 
                <p>When creating your playlist, make a variety of kinds of music, and one of them should be a 
                    folder of songs that you used to hear when you were growing up. This depends on your age. 
                    So for me, this is an example of a good old song I used to hear when I was a kid, and when I 
                    hear it, it makes me appreciate my childhood and my past, and listening to it makes me grateful!</p>

            <h3>Upbeat Music</h3>
            <div class="music2">
                <p>When I think of upbeat music, I think of music that as soon as you play it, it just magically 
                    puts you in a good mood as if you can accomplish anything you want to do! Upbeat music is 
                    probably one of the most important purposes of music, to give you upbeat, happy feelings! It 
                    makes you want to dance, sing, and simply happy! So the next time you play your favorite upbeat
                    music, play it on a good quality speakers and either sing or dance with it! Just take time to 
                    feel the beat or enjoy the music! </p>

            <h3>Inspiring Music</h3>
            <div class="music3">
                <p>Whether we like it or not,  the kind of music we listen to, especially the lyrics can affect us 
                    either positively or negatively. Therefore, it’s very important to choose a type of music that 
                    can inspire you to do good and be a force of great things to others! </p> 
                <p>Here’s a good playlist to start with. Inspiring music varies to people, but you can also try 
                    instrumental music, like plain piano or violin.</p>
                <p>Music could have a great powerful effect in our lives. Continue exploring the type of music 
                    that will boost your mood and your life!
