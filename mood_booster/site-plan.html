        Everyday, when we wake up in the morning, our mind is like on a reset mode. Whatever happened the day before, 
        either we had positive or negative experiences, a new day is like a new opportunity for us to start clean again. 
        It's therefore very important to feed it from the beginning positive and inspiring ideas. This positive start 
        will enable us to face roadblocks we will encounter during the day with a winning attitude.

        There have been many wonderful people from the past that we can learn many lessons from. These people have 
        already been through lots of experiences and have offered us their wise words, so we don not keep repeating the 
        same mistakes over and over again. It is very important to listen to their words and apply their teachings so we 
        can get the best out of the opportunities that are before us!

        This website will provide you with these wise words but in the form of a meme. A meme because it is a way to 
        enjoy inspiring words in a colorful and entertaining way.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Good music impacts our health in many good ways. It boosts our mood when we are feeling down or tired. 
        According to science and research, listening to the music we like releases dopamine chemicals in our brain which 
        makes us feel happier. Since there are lots of kinds of music, choose the type of music that will make you happy! 

        We also need to consider the type of music we listen to. The beat is great but what is more important are the 
        lyrics that it contains. It is very important to listen to uplifting music so it can fill our minds with positive 
        inspiration. We should do our best to avoid negative and depressing songs which is so rampant in today's music 
        industry.

        So throughout the day, when you notice your energy levels are getting low, try to take a break and listen to music. 
        Taking time to take a break and do something that you enjoy like listening to music will help you relax. It will 
        recharge you and you are happy and ready to do the rest of your duties!
