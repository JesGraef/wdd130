    <h2>Jessa Graef</h2>
    <p>My name is Jessa Graef. The picture is me with my husband successfully photobombing my picture😅! 
        I'm originally majoring in Applied Technology but I'm switching 
        to Applied Business Management. I just find coding too hard, and business is easier! 
        I'm married with 3 little boys. I love to play the piano during my free time. </p>
    <p>Now that I'm learning about web designs, if I find it fun desiging websites, 
        I might continue my major in Applied Technology. I am really still trying to find out my passions. 
        But my dream job is to work in a big tech company someday like Apple or Amazon. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is 1 Nephi 18:3 “And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, 
        and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.” 
        I know that as we trust more in God and less in our limited abilities, and counsel with Him 
        in everything we do, He will lead us to the “most fertile parts of the land”.</p>
